One of the main benefits of programming is we don't work in isolation. 
We can import modules that contain code that we can use to help us write our own programs. 

We use online documentation like MDN and W3Schools to help us learn how to utilize aspects of a programming language. 
We use online forums like Stack Overflow and Google to find answers to specific problems. 

We even use other people like our classmates, TAs, and instructors to help figure out how to solve problems.

We can also use other people's data in our applications. 
There are multiple ways of using other people's data, or external data, in our applications. 

In this chapter, we will focus on using fetch() and JSON to request and use data.
