Browsers can't stop everything and wait for a response to an HTTP request. 
Browsers have to render HTML, interact with the user, and run JavaScript. 

To keep these processes running seamlessly, without any noticeable pauses, the browser relies on events.

This is where .then() and the response handler function come in. 
The browser provides us with a way to handle the response whenever it is received.
