<!-- 
    Now that we know what an API is, let's use one to update a web page. 
    Let's use a weather API to add weather data to a web page. The URL for 
    this special LaunchCode weather API is https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json.

Example JSON returned from our weather API. -->

{
    "temp": 67,
    "windSpeed": 5,
    "tempMin": 50,
    "tempMax": 71,
    "status": "Sunny",
    "chanceOfPrecipitation": 20,
    "zipcode": 63108
 }

 <!-- We can see that this API returns useful information like temp and windSpeed. 
    Our goal is to add that data to a Launch Status web page. Note, this API is for 
    instruction purposes and does not contain real time data.

<!-- EXAMPLE: Launch Status web page, which we will add weather data to. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Launch Status</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Launch Status</h1>
      <h3>Weather Conditions</h3>
      <div id="weather-conditions">
         <!-- TODO: dynamically add html about weather using data from API -->
      </div>
