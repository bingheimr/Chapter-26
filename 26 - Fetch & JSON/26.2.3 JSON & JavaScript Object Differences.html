<!-- JSON is rooted in JavaScript objects syntax. However, there are some key differences between the two.

JSON keys MUST be in double quotes. Double quotes should not be used when declaring properties for a JavaScript object.

<!-- To represent a string in JSON, you MUST use double quotes. 
    In JavaScript, you can use double quotes or single quotes.
