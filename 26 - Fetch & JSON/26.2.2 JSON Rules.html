<!-- JSON is a collection of key-value pairs. In the example above, 
    "title" is a key and it's value is "An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth".

The key-value pairs describe the data that is being transferred.

A JSON key MUST be a string, but the value may be a number, string, boolean, array, object, or null.

In the example above, the JSON describes one object, a book! All of the keys 
are strings, and the values are: string, string, number, number, array, and boolean respectively.

JSON can also be used to describe a collection of objects at the same time. 


Consider we search for the word "Astronaut". -->

<!-- This time, our search term "Astronaut" returned multiple books, and so a collection of book objects was returned in JSON format.

Each book object can be found in the array with the key "book". 
Each book contains the keys "title", "author", "ISBN", "year_published", "subject", and "available".

When we make a request to an API, the API formats the data we requested into JSON and 
then responds to our request with the JSON representation of our request. -->
