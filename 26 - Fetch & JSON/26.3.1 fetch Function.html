<!-- 
    To request the weather data, we will use the fetch function. 
    
    fetch is a global function that requests, or fetches, resources such as data from an API.


    Take note of two necessary aspects of the fetch function:

    1. The URL of where the data is located.
        a. For this example, it will be "https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json"
    
    2. A response handler function to utilize the data that is being fetched.
        b. For this example, it will be function(response){...}; -->

<!-- EXAMPLE: Notice a string URL is passed to fetch. 
    Also notice the anonymous request handler function that has a response parameter. 
    The .then method will be explained soon. -->

fetch("https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json").then(function(response) {
   console.log(response);
} );

<!-- In this example, we are requesting data from https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json 
    and our response handler (the anonymous function) simply logs the response to the console.-->
