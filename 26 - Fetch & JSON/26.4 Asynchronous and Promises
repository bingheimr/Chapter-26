In order to fully explain how the fetch function works, we need to 
define and talk about the terms asynchronous and synchronous.

    -Asynchronous: Not simultaneous or concurrent in time.

    -Synchronous: Simultaneous or concurrent in time.

When fetching data in JavaScript, the HTTP requests are asynchronous. 

In brief, that means when an HTTP request is sent, we don't know exactly 
when a response will be received by the browser. 

Remember that HTTP requests are sent to an address, then a response is sent. That process takes a 
variable amount of time depending on network speed, the address location, and response size.

Note:
These requests are also called AJAX requests (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). 
The XML part of AJAX refers to a data format that was popular before JSON
