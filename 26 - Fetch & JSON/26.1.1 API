When using a website, we mainly work with GUIs (Graphical User Interface) 
which contain buttons, forms, text boxes, etc. However, our program does not 
know how to use a GUI. Programs use APIs (Application Programming Interface) 
to communicate with other programs.

Consider the software you use on a daily basis, like Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, 
or a music streaming device like Spotify. When you open the software, a window pops 
up on your screen and is filled with text, buttons, search bars, scroll bars, etc. 

Usually, with a little trial and error, you can learn how to use the interface easily. 
This interface we use is called a Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short.

We interact with computers using various interfaces, either with a GUI or a CLI. 
However, an application does not know how to use a GUI, or a CLI, and needs its 
own interface to communicate with another application. 

An API is the interface that allows one application to communicate with another application.

An API is how one application communicates with another application. 
We will be making a request to an API in order to retrieve information we need for our application.
