Now let's add fetch in the Launch Status web page.

<!-- Example
A <script> tag has been added that includes:

    1. A load event handler on line 6.
    2. A fetch and response handler function on line 7.
    3. A console.log(response); on line 8 that prints out the response object. -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <head>
          <title>Launch Status</title>
          <script>
             window.addEventListener("load", function() {
                fetch("https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json").then(function(response) {
                   console.log(response);
                } );
             });
          </script>
       </head>
       <body>
          <h1>Launch Status</h1>
          <h3>Weather Conditions</h3>
          <div id="weather-conditions">
             <!-- TODO: dynamically add html about weather using data from API -->
          </div>
       </body>
    </html>

<!-- Let's break down how fetch works:

    1. A URL is passed to fetch as a parameter.
    2. This causes an HTTP GET request to be sent from the browser to the API.
    3. The API processes the request and sends back a response, which contains data.
    4. Once the browser receives the response, the .then() statement executes.
    5. The anonymous response handler function called by .then(function(response) runs, and this function deals with the data sent back from the API.
    6. Based on the code in the handler function, the web page gets updated using DOM methods. -->

    <!-- NOTE:
    In this section, fetch is used to make GET requests. fetch can also be used to make other types of HTTP requests such as POST and PUT.
