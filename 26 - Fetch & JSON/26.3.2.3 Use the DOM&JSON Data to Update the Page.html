Now that we have JSON weather data, we can add HTML elements to the page 
to display that data.

EXAMPLE:
1. On line 18, the div object is defined and linked to the HTML element 
with the id weather-conditions.

2. On line 20, the innerHTML property of the div object is set to 
be the HTML elements in lines 11 - 16.

<html>
   <head>
      <title>Launch Status</title>
      <script>
         window.addEventListener("load", function() {
            fetch("https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/weather.json").then( function(response) {
               response.json().then( function(json) {
                  const div = document.getElementById("weather-conditions");
                  // Add HTML that includes the JSON data
                  div.innerHTML = `
                     <ul>
                        <li>Temp ${json.temp}</li>
                        <li>Wind Speed ${json.windSpeed}</li>
                        <li>Status ${json.status}</li>
                        <li>Chance of Precip ${json.chanceOfPrecipitation}</li>
                     </ul>
                  `;
               });
            });
         });
      </script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Launch Status</h1>
      <h3>Weather Conditions</h3>
      <div id="weather-conditions">
         <!-- Weather data is added here dynamically. -->
      </div>
   </body>
</html>

Let's take a look at the expected sequence of events:

1. In line 6, the fetch command sends a request to the URL.

2. When the API returns a response, the then method calls the anonymous 
handler function and passes in the response object (also line 6).

3. On line 7, the handler function tries to retrieve the JSON data from the response object. 
When this is successful, the anonymous function(json) gets called.
    a. On line 8, the div object is defined and linked to the HTML element with the id weather-conditions.
    b. On line 10, the innerHTML property of the div object is set to be the HTML elements in lines 11 - 16.
    c. The HTML in lines 11 - 16 gets filled in using weather data stored in the json object.

4. The two anonymous functions end, and the HTML defined in lines 11 - 16 gets added to the div element on line 26.

NOTE: 
fetch was chosen as the tool to request data because it's supported in modern 
browsers by default and is simple to use. When viewing resources other than 
this book, you will see various other ways to request data in a web page with 
JavaScript. Other ways include, but are not limited to, jQuery.get, jQuery.ajax, 
and XMLHttpRequest.
