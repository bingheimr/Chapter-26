In order for our application to make a request to an API, the data will 
need to be formatted in a way both our application and the API can understand.

The API may have been built with another programming language. 
And it may not use the same variables, objects, and data structures as JavaScript. 

To solve the issue of APIs being built in different programming languages, data formats are used.

A data format is a set of rules that govern how data is written, organized, and labeled. 
Data formats make working with data consistent and reliable.
